My first workaction is over. Instead of staying in Hamburg and working in my Homeoffice I spent a week with my younger son in a small Hotel <https://seehaus-wille.de/> in Kargow.
I woke up at six, showered, got dressed, meditated and started working around seven. I did work for 1,5 hours until my son got up and we had breakfast together.
After breakfast I would continue working until around twelve.

To get the most out of the day for my son and me, we had a long lunch break (2-3 hours). We would either drive to Neustrelitz to have some lunch or  we would eat something in our apartment.
I did cook two fairly simple meals during the week in our small kitchen.

While cooking I use the app crouton <https://crouton.app/> on my iPad for the recipes.

After lunch I would continue working until around six or so.

Pro:
It was nice to spent some time somewhere else. We were very lucky regarding the weather. It was kind of warm and sunny (for october, almost november) and we could spent a lot of time outside. A lot, at least if I take into account that I was also working around eight hours a day.

The WIFI connection from the Hotel was stable all the time. I was a bit concerned because we had no cell reception here. Nothing, not even edge.
Apart from my laptop, I brought also my external keyboard an my monitor. A very good decision after all.

Con:
The weather was also the downside or rather the work part from the workaction. It would be nicer to spent whole days outside, in this beautiful nature.
I missed my height-adjustable desk and my ofice chair. To bring the office chair would be a bit too much but I would definetly bring my office stool next time.
I did only three [scatterfocus](https://alexfuerstenau.com/2024/09/10/Scatterfocus.html) sessions during the week. I was sitting outside, trying to connect the dots.

All in all it was a good experience. No major downsides. Definetly something I might be doing again. :-)
