summary: My daily checkin routine for the last couple of weeks
---

I do start my working days for some weeks now with a daily check-in routine/list.  
It ~~only~~ has 4 items at the moment:
1. Check the calendar - how much capacity do I have today?
Step 1 usually takes only a few seconds. Did I forget about a meeting I need to prepare something for? These kind of things.
1. What is already on my today view in Things3?
Given my calendar from step 1, do I have enough capacity to achieve what I need to be doing?
1. Clarify what's in the Things3 inbox
By going through my inbox in Things3 regularly in the morning, I already convince my head that my system is up to date. It also doesnâ€™t happen that I have 20 or 30 items in my inbox, which also means I can remember what I meant when I put it in there. ðŸ˜‰
I used to do it occasionally every second day or so or at least during the weeklyreview. But it was sometimes overwhelming to clarify 20 or 30 items.
1. Check e-mail
