A fact is a fact but „the truth“ is changing all the time
A scientific fact is agreed if enough people believe that it is true.
Believe in this context is usually a theory and a vast amount of supporting experiments which support the fact or at least don’t falsify it.
Then, the fact comes into existence.
It is a fact until someone finds a theory, backed with experiments, which proves the fact wrong.
This happens all the time.

Earth – round not flat
Back in the days people believed that the earth is flat. It it now a fact that it isn’t and it never was.
A lot of chemicals were believed to be harmless in the 1950s or 1960s, but today we know, they are not and they never were.

The facts don’t suddenly change. The earth wasn’t flat and nicotine wasn’t healthy. We just didn’t knew better back in the days.

But „the truth“ is changing all the time, let’s get used to it.
