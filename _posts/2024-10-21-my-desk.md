I bought the [height-adjustable desk](https://www.flexispot.de/elektrisch-hohenverstellbares-tischgestell-e1.html), a FlexiSpot EF1 with a bamboo panel, about two years ago. An exceptional good investment if you use it.
It can store up to four different heights, I currently use three of them.
I try to switch my position after every pomodori. My pomodori length is 45 minutes at the moment. It works well before lunch but I keep sitting in the chair after lunch most of the time.
I start my day standing, going through my [daily check-in](https://alexfuerstenau.com/productivity/2024/03/09/daily-check-in-checklist.html) list.
After that I switch to the stool. I bought that one a couple of months back. It's quite comfy but it took some time to get used to it.
After that I switch to my office chair. I bought that one in 2020, you know COVID and stay at home and so on, so sitting on a regular chair all day was not an option for long.

I bougth the monitor ([Dell U2421E, 24 inch, Full HD](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08KP4GFXW/)) and a small soundbar ([Dell EMV DELL Slim SB521A](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08MSR3BCB/)), which is barely noticable right below the monitor, a couple of months ago. The monitor fits nicely into the window opening, anything wider and I couldn't work in a standing position. The monitor works perfectly with my Mac Book Air M1 via USB-C. It wakes up within a few seconds after connecting them and it remembers the last setup.

I bought the M1 four years ago and it is still fast enough for the things I am doing. A new Mac Book Pro might be nice but I mean "no fan" is just perfect. I don't want to hear my computer - at all.

I switched to a wireless keyboard with TouchId a couple of months ago. It's nice and I don't want to go back but I can live with the Standard non-TouchId keyboard in the office.

I do use the Apple Magic Mouse for ten years or so. I charge it once a month or so. No big deal that you can't use it while charging.

The headset is a [Jabra Engage 50 II](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0B783RJWG/). It helps a bit to keep the surrounding sounds at bay, either at home or in the office.
