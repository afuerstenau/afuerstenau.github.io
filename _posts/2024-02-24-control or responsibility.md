You cannot delegate responsibility.  
Imagine your boss gives you some work to do. But you cannot do it all by yourself. You need some help from a colleague. So, you finish your work and then ask your colleague to do the final 5% or so.
After a couple of days, your boss asks whether the task is done.
What do you say? "I don't know, I delegated it to John. Can you ask John about it?"

You're probaly not ask 
Thats why your task is in the waiting for state or has a waiting for tag assigned to it even if your work is 100% done. You were given the task, you are responsible until it is done.
